Name:        sound_data_walk.py
Description: the music the sound driver plays, walked from where its song table points as the driver reads it
Version:     0.1.0

The sound coverage (tools/core/sound_coverage.py, the profile's SOUND_DATA_WALK) hands spans() the places
sound_symbols.txt's tables point at whose length only the data says: here the music tracks, the 9 a song
(songs: 7 on the YM2151's channels 1-7, then the K007232's two), which read_track_command (0A46) reads a
command at a time. A byte below E0 is one byte: 0x the octave (track_set_octave), 7x the volume step
(track_set_volume_step), any other a note, its length by its high nibble (note_lengths) and its pitch by its
low one (0: a rest). E0-FF take arguments (the jump tables track_commands_e0, track_commands_f0):
  1 argument   E0-E4, E6-EB, EE, EF, F2, F4, FC-FE
  2            ED (the YM2151's LFO)
  E5           a note held over several lengths: a byte of a length and a pitch, then lengths two a byte up
               to the first nibble that is 0 (that byte too)
  EC           a count, two transpositions and an address: jumps there (the count times), else goes on
  F0           an address: jumps there
  F1           a count and an address: goes on (the count times less one), then jumps there
  F6           a count and an address: plays the part there the count times (F7 returns from it)
  F8, FA       an address: plays the part there (F9, FB return)
  F3, F5       no argument: the ends of the loops F2 and F4 start (they go back to after them)
  F7, F9, FB   no argument: the returns
  FF           no argument: the end of the track
Every place a track jumps or calls to is walked too, as part of the music. The walk is right when every
byte the track reader and its commands read in the scenarios is in what it walked: the coverage's --reads
(the reference's sound_rom_reads.txt, kref --sound-rom-reads) lists the bytes read that nothing describes.
