/**
 *    Name:        game.h
 *    Description: the game as the ports run it: the board with the assets in place of the ROM, the program on
 *                 it, its frames drawn
 *    Version:     0.1.0
 *    Created:     29-10-2026
 *    Modified:    29-10-2026

 *    license:BSD-3-Clause
 *    The ports (ports/headless, ports/sdl2) load the assets, reset the game and run it; the program calls
 *    their program_frame_done (tmnt/program.h) after each frame's VBLANK events, where they apply the
 *    controls, show the frame, queue its sound and take its hashes. The program's data is the assets'
 *    pieces (game/assets.h): the game opens no ROM.
