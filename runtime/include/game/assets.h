/**
 *    Name:        assets.h
 *    Description: the game's assets (tools/extract_assets.py writes them from the player's ROM set) loaded
 *                 into the board's memories and the program's data, by name
 *    Version:     0.1.0
 *    Created:     29-10-2026
 *    Modified:    29-10-2026
 *    Author:      Sebastian Toyos
 *
 *    license:BSD-3-Clause
 *    What the game reads at start instead of the ROM: the tiles and the sprites (PNG sheets) into the video
 *    chips' memories (game/data.h's game_tiles, game_sprites, as the chips read them), the samples (WAV)
 *    into the sound chips' (game_pcm, game_speech, game_title), and the data of both programs (text pieces,
 *    each by name) into pieces the code finds by name or by the address the pieces' layout gives them (the
 *    places the data's own pointers hold).
