/**
 *    Name:        support.h
 *    Description: what the decompiled 68000 program (src/) uses besides its own C: the work RAM, the program's data
 *                 from the assets, the board's devices on the bus, the frame and the interrupts, and the 68000's
 *                 arithmetic where the IR does not spell it out
 *    Version:     0.1.0
 *    Created:     29-10-2026
 *    Modified:    29-10-2026
 *    Author:      Sebastian Toyos
 *
 *    license:BSD-3-Clause
 *    The work RAM is the board's (tmnt/machine.h), which keeps it the other way round (the byte at the RAM's last
 *    address first), so that a value of the big-endian 68000 at any address is a plain lvalue of the host's,
 *    which is little endian: RAM16(address) is the 16-bit variable there, and ram.h (tools/decompile.py) names
 *    them. An array of the work RAM runs the other way in the host's memory: ram.h writes its elements as
 *    NAME(index), a macro of each element's place. A part of a variable is the host's part of it (AS8, AT8: the
 *    place from the host's end of the variable, cprint.part in the decompiler). The build turns strict aliasing
 *    off for this code.
 *
 *    The program's data is its assets' (game/assets.h): a table the C reads by name is NAME[i], a copy the loader
 *    makes of it with each element in the host's byte order (the registry in src/table.c gives the width); an
 *    address the program keeps in its variables (a pointer into its data) is the identity of a piece, and
 *    DATA16(address) reads the data there as the program has it, big endian. The board's devices (the palette,
 *    the inputs, the K052109 and K051960...) are reached through the bus, by name: mem_read8(IO_0A0013).
